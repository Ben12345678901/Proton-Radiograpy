# Proton-Radiograpy
Simple proton radiography code that utilises a lorentz function to track the trajectories of charged particles passing through a magnetic field, scattering physics is not included. Functions for both cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems and is fully parralised using chunks.

This is built off of Plasmpy's synthetic radiography function
